*When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When you have files that are working and ready to be viewed by others.

*Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So you can select which files youâ€™d like to keep developing and leave others stored externally.
